Wraith is a screenshot comparison tool, created by developers at BBC News.


## What is it?

Wraith uses either [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) or
[SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org) to create screen-shots of different environments
and then creates a diff of the two images, the affected areas are highlighted in
blue

## Requirements

You'll need either PhantomJS or SlimerJS, ImageMagick & Ruby 1.9.3 or greater.
It's up to you to decide which browser engine you want to run it against.

### OSX
On Mac OS X, the best way to install dependencies is if you have [homebrew](http://brew.sh).  It is the quickest way to install PhantomJS & ImageMagick.

    brew install imagemagick
    brew install phantomjs or brew install slimerjs
    
### Windows
On Windows it's important to install ImageMagick from the binary found [here](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows). 
This will ensure that ImageMagick is listed first in your PATH.

To check your path after installing, open a command line window and type:

    path

This will return a list of executables in you PATH separated by semi-colons ;

    C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.8.7-Q16;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows...

If ImageMagick is in your path but not listed first you can edit your path by following the instructions [here](http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx)

If ImageMagick is not in your PATH at all but you have it installed you will need to add it in. Follow the instructions from the link above and add in the path to where you have ImageMagick installed. For example C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.8.7-Q16; 
Make sure the version number and location are correct for your system.

### Ubuntu
On Ubuntu 12.04, you will need to apt-get the following packages:

* libicu-dev
* imagemagick
* rake

And then download the PhantomJS binary package from
[http://phantomjs.org/](http://phantomjs.org/).

## Installation

Open terminal and run

    git clone https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith

You can then run the following inside the Wraith directory:
    
    bundle install

If you don't have bundler installed, install it :

    gem install bundler


Alternatively you can download the install script via curl, this will not create a git repo though.    
    
    curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/bbc-news/wraith/go/install | bash
    cd wraith
    bundle install

### Installing via bundler
Add this to your ```Gemfile```
```gem 'wraith', "1.1.0", :git=>"git://github.com/meza/wraith.git"```

## Config

All config options will be placed in config.yaml. You can specify the snap file name, this could be used in a situation where you have a large amount of config files.  You can set the headless browser, domains of the 2 sites you are comparing, URL paths, screen widths & HTTP headers.  If you don't want to set paths, you can use the spidering option to check your entire website  Remove/comment out the `path:` entries in `config.yaml`.

```yaml

# Headless browser option
browser:
  webkit: "phantomjs"
  # gecko: "slimerjs"

# If you want to have multiple snapping files, set the file name here
snap_file: "snap.js"

# Type the name of the directory that shots will be stored in
directory:
  - 'shots'

# Add only 2 domains, key will act as a label
domains:
  english: "http://www.live.bbc.co.uk/news"
  russian: "http://www.live.bbc.co.uk/russian"

#Type screen widths below, here are a couple of examples
screen_widths:
  - 320
  - 600
  - 768
  - 1024
  - 1280

#Type page URL paths below, here are a couple of examples
paths:
  home: /
  uk_index: /uk

# If you don't want to name the paths explicitly you can use a yaml
# collection as follows, and names will be derived by replacing / with _
#
# paths:
#  - /imghp
#  - /maps

#Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use 
fuzz: '20%' 

#Set the number of days to keep the site spider file
spider_days:
  - 10

```

You can also specify PhantomJS command line options in config.yaml.

For example to tell PhantomJS to ignore SSL errors:

```yaml
phantomjs_options: "--ignore-ssl-errors=true"
```

## Using Wraith

If you are new to ruby, rake and PhantomJS, [here is a great screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE_19L0l2q0) about how to use Wraith by [Kevin Lamping](https://twitter.com/klamping)

There are two ways of using Wraith, the fastest is to simply type rake.

```sh
rake
```

You may want to deal with multiple config files so you can compare different pages, different sites or different viewports.  In order to handle this, you can pass in a different config file by typing the following into terminal.  The default is config.yaml, so even if you don't pass a file in, it will still run.  If you have deleted config.yaml, make sure you are inside the `configs` directory before running the command.

```sh
rake config[config_name]
```

On Windows before running the rake command you will need to make a small edit to the wraith.rb file.
Locate lines 60 and 70 and switch the commenting as described.


### Using as a gem

Install the gem as described above.
Then:

```ruby
def run_wraith
	@config = ('config')
	folders = Wraith::FolderManager.new(@config)
    folders.clear_shots_folder
    folders.create_folders
    spider = Wraith::Spidering.new(@config)
    spider.check_for_paths
    @save_images = Wraith::SaveImages.new(@config)
    @save_images.save_images
    crop = Wraith::CropImages.new(@save_images.directory, @config)
    crop.crop_images
    compare = Wraith::CompareImages.new(@config)
    compare.compare_images
    thumbs = Wraith::Thumbnails.new(@config)
    thumbs.generate_thumbnails
    gallery = Wraith::GalleryGenerator.new(@save_images.directory)
    gallery.generate_gallery
end
```


## Output

After each screenshot is captured, the compare task will run, this will output a diff.png and a data.txt.  The data.txt for each file will show the number of pixels that have changed.  There is a main data.txt which is in the root of the output folder that will combine all of these values to easier view all the pixel changes.

## Gallery

A gallery is available to view each of the images and the respective diff images located in the shots folder once all the images have been compared.

## Grabber

If you just want to see a single domains images and not compare them, perhaps for archiving, remove a domain and run the new rake task.   For default config, use grab, or specify a config using grabber. 

`rake grab` and `rake grabber[config]`

## Contributing
